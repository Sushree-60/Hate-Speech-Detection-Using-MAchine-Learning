# Hate-Speech-Detection-Using-MAchine-Learning
We collected manually publicly available hate speech social network datasets. In this dataset, the comments are labeled into two distinct classes, namely, hate speech or offensive words, and normal speech.The main objective of this work is to develop an automatically identify and classify instances of hate speech in text-based communication channels approach for detecting hate speech and offensive language such as social media platforms, online forums, and chat rooms.
